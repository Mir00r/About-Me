# About-Me
The AboutMe app demonstrates how to work with LinearLayout using the Android Studio's Layout Edior. This app consists of a TextView to show text, an ImageView, and a ScrollView with scrollable text.This app consists of a field to enter a nickname, a DONE button and a text view to display the nickname. Once the user enters a nickname and tap the DONE button, the text view updates to show the entered nickname. The nickname can be updated by tapping the text view with data binding techniques used to eliminate findViewById() calls and access data from views.
